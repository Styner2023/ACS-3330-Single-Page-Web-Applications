# Color Challenge

I found this challenge on Client.dev they provide interview type questions for front end developers. 

## Challenge

Your goal is to display three random color swatches as 100px by 100px squares. Below you will show the hext color of one of these swatches. When a swatch is clicked display a message "correct" if the color of the swatch matches the hex color displayed, or incorrect if it does not match.
