## Interview problem

Create a React app that tracks a collection of coins. You need to count the number of Pennies, Nickles, Dimes, and Quarters. You'll also show the total amount of all coins. 

You should have a button that adds one of each coin type. 

Your final work might look like this:

Your page should have the following elements: 

- title
- total - displays the total amount of all coins
- pennies - displays the number of pennies collected
- nickles - display the number of nickles collected
- dimes - displays the number of dimes collected
- quarters - displays the number quarters collected

Your finished app should work like the animated gif below. When the buttons are clicked notice the count of coins and the total amount are updated.
