## Use useState

<!-- > -->

Import `useState` from react

```JS
import { useState } from 'react'
```

<!-- > -->

Use `useState` to generate a state variable and setter function that that variable. 

```JS
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  ...
}
```

<small>`count` is the variable, and `setCount` is the setter. The initial value of `count` is 0. </small>

<!-- > -->

```JS
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);` ðŸ¤”

What is this? You should already be familiar with deconstructions with Objects. Deconstruction can also be applied to Arrays. 

```JS 
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
const [ one, two, three ] = numbers
```

With an object similar code might look like this: 

```JS 
const numbers = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
const { one, two, three } = numbers
```

With objects, you must use the keys to assign the values. So the new variables created on line 2 number have the names `one`, `two`, and `three`. 

In the Array example on line 2 the new variables created can have any name and they are assigned a value based on their index!

### Why hooks? 

React also supports components written as classes. We won't be covering these in class as they seem to be out and the world is functional components and hooks instead. 

Classes take extra syntax to generate and are more complex to decipher and debug. Functions are more straightforward to troubleshoot. 

### Controlled Component Pattern

<!-- > -->

The controlled component pattern is used to handle form input in React projects. 

<!-- > -->

```JS
function MyComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  return (
    <input 
      value={name}
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
    />
  )
}
```

<small>Here name stores the value displayed in the input.</small>

<!-- > -->

Here the component was created from a function but has access to state (`count`). 

To use state with hooks follow these steps

1. When using `useState` you'll need to import it first. 
1. Call `useState(initialValue)` with the initial value. 
1. Deconstruct with the array syntax to get the value and setter function. 
 - In the example above the value is `count`
 - The setter us `useCount`
1. To change the value of state call your setter with a new value: `setCount(99)`

It's a convention to name your variable and precede the setter with 'set'. 

You'll use this same pattern for all form controls! Things like `<select>` (creates a menu), checkboxes and radio buttons, etc. 

Imagine the component above also had a check box. 

```JS
function MyComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [newsletter, setNewsletter] = useState(true)

  return (
    <input 
      value={name}
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
    />
    <input 
      checked={newsletter}
      onChange={() => setPeperoni(!newsletter)}
    />
  )
}
```

Here the check box is controlled by the `newsLetter` "state" variable. This variable reflects its value in the interface element and clicking the checkbox updates the variable. 

## Challenge 

Imagine this challenge as an easy front-end interview question. Solve the problem here: https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-3330-Single-Page-Web-Applications/blob/master/Lessons/lab-03.md

## Lifecycle methods and Hooks 

```JS
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Introduction 

<!-- > -->

The demo project is a simple web app that displays weather data. You'll need to make an account and get a valid API key. 

The project needs to accept user input for a zipcode. Text input and other form elements use a special pattern in React called the _Controlled Component Pattern_.

## React State 

<!-- > -->

State represents a value a component stores internally.

<!-- > -->

When state changes a component renders

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions to set up and run the demo project.

- Download or fork the [project](https://github.com/Product-College-Labs/react-api-project)
- Make an account with [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/)
 - Go to your profile page: API Keys
 - Generate and copy your API key
 - Add the following to the '.env' file: 

`REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

**Pro-tip!** 

- The Create React App starter project is set up to use `dotenv`, you don't need to add this package. 
- Any environment variables you define **must** begin with `REACT_APP_`. This prevents clashes with environment variables that you may not be aware of. 

Read more about [Adding Custom Environment Variables](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)

Everything in the example project happens in App.js. There are many comments explaining what is going on, read these closely.

- `npm install`
- `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Input Pattern 

The project has a single input field. Find it in the `render` method of App.js. 

```JavaScript
<input 
  value={this.state.inputValue} 
  onChange={e => this.setState({ inputValue: e.target.value })}
  type="text" 
  pattern="(\d{5}([\-]\d{4})?)"
  placeholder="enter zip"
/>
```

This started as a simple input element. 

`<input type="text">`

The input should take a zip code so I set the placeholder to "enter zip" and used the pattern attribute and a little regex "magic" to limit input to zip code patterns. 

```JavaScript
<input 
  ...
  type="text" 
  pattern="(\d{5}([\-]\d{4})?)"
  placeholder="enter zip"
/>
```

The `value` and `onChange` attributes are used for the React input pattern.

```JavaScript
<input 
  value={this.state.inputValue} 
  onChange={e => this.setState({ inputValue: e.target.value })}
  ...
/>
```

The controlled component pattern stores the value entered on `this.state` and displays the value in the component via its value attribute. 

Imagine you are entering a zip code into a text input field. You type the first number of the zip code which is 9. The onChange method fires and assigns the value in the text field to state with: `this.setState({zip:e.target.value})`. When the component is rendered the value displayed is the value set on state `this.state.zip`.

This may seem a little strange, but it's important for two reasons. 

- React's virtual DOM may replace the input component at any time when the DOM is redrawn. This would lose values stored in real DOM elements. 
- It stores input values on `state` where they are easy to access when you need them without having to access the input and retrieve its value.

## Challenges 

Use `array.filter()` to solve some of the challenges. Filter is a method of Array that returns a new array that is a subset of the source array. Like, map and reduce filter takes a callback. The callback is passed to each element from the source array and it determines if that item should be included in the output array by returning true or false if the item should not be included.
